* @function equalRiskContributionWeights
*
* @summary Compute the weights of the equally weighted risk contribution portfolio.
*
* @description This function returns the weights w_1,...,w_n associated to the fully invested and long-only portfolio
* of n assets with equal risk contributions, defined as the weights with the property that the contribution 
* of each asset to the risk of the portfolio is equal.
*
* This portfolio is unique, provided the covariance matrix of the assets is definite positive.
* 
* This portfolio is a trade-off between the MV portfolio and the EW portfolio.
* It can be viewed as an ERB portfolio tilted toward the assets less correlated with other assets.
*
* This portfolio is a special case of the more generic risk budgeting portfolio, with all risk budgets
* equal.
*
* The algorithm used is a cyclical coordinate descent, c.f. the second reference, whose convergence is guaranteed
* if the covariance matrix of the assets is definite positive.

* 
* @param {Array.<Array.<number>>} sigma the covariance matrix (sigma_ij),i,j=1..n of the n assets in the considered universe, array of n array of n real numbers statisfying sigma[i-1][j-1] = sigma_ij.
* @param {object} opt the optional parameters for the algorithm.
* @param {number} opt.eps the tolerance parameter for the convergence of the algorithm, a strictly positive real number; defaults to 1e-8.
* @param {number} opt.maxIter the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm, a strictly positive natural integer; defaults to 1000.
* @return {Array.<number>} the weights corresponding to the equal risk contributions portfolio, array of n real numbers.
